I wanted to let you know that the `social-media-dashboard` branch in my GitHub repository now contains a new folder dedicated to Task 3 of my CodeAlpha internship. This task involved creating a **Social Media Dashboard** that aggregates content from various social media platforms, allowing users to log in, connect their accounts, and view their feeds in one place.

Feel free to explore the project here:https://github.com/zoyasultan61/CodeAlpha_Project_Name--.gitðŸ“‚
